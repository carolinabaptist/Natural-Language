Grammatical System

Language has a grammatical system that defines its rules and structures. Grammar includes rules for 
syntax (how to organize words into sentences) and morphology (how words are formed and modified). 
These rules are fundamental for efficient and coherent communication, both in natural languages 
​​(such as English or Portuguese) and in formal languages.

Each language has its own rules that govern how sounds, words, and sentences are organized and 
understood. Even though some rules may be similar across different languages, many are unique 
and reflect the culture and history of a people.

Communication is the primary function of language. It allows people to express thoughts, emotions 
and intentions in a structured way. This is essential not only in speech and writing, but also in
the digital context, where NLP tries to decipher and generate human language to improve human-machine
interaction.

Human language is natural, that is, it develops spontaneously in individuals through social 
interaction. Unlike artificial languages ​​(such as programming languages), natural languages ​​evolve 
organically.

Languages ​​evolve naturally as people communicate and adapt language to new realities. New terms are 
created, expressions change meaning and language adapts to new social and technological contexts.

New words are created every day. This can happen due to technological innovation, cultural changes,
or influences from other languages. In PLN, dealing with these new words (called out-of-vocabulary 
words or words outside the vocabulary) is a constant challenge.

New words are constantly being added to languages due to cultural, technological, and social 
changes.

Examples:
Selfie: This word gained popularity around 2012 and was officially added to dictionaries shortly after.
Binge-watch: This became common with the rise of platforms like Netflix.
Thou: An archaic form of "you" in singular form, used frequently in Middle English and Early 
Modern English. It's no longer in everyday use except in specific contexts (e.g., poetry, 
religious texts).

Natural languages are those that have evolved organically among humans for communication.

Portuguese: A Romance language that evolved from Latin.
English: A Germanic language with significant influences from Latin and French.
Portuguese Sign Language: A visual-gestural natural language used by the deaf community 
in Portugal. It's an example of a sign language, which, like spoken languages, evolves 
naturally within communities.
Esperanto is not a natural language, but rather a constructed language (conlang). It was 
created in the late 19th century by L. L. Zamenhof with the aim of promoting international 
communication. Although it has a relatively small community of speakers, Esperanto did not 
evolve naturally from human interaction but was designed intentionally with simplified grammar 
and vocabulary from various European languages.

NLP: Field of Artificial Intelligence and Linguistics concerned with the interactions between 
computers and human natural languages.

Challenges

Language variability:  common challenge in developing dialogue systems in Natural Language 
Processing (NLP). Multiple phrases are used to express the same request. Ex: "Switch on the light!",
"Switch the light on!", "Turn the light on!" etc. Even though all these sentences have the same intent (turning on the light), the phrasing 
differs significantly. A well-designed dialogue system (like a chatbot or virtual assistant) 
must be able to understand the different ways people express the same idea (despite varied 
sentence structure or vocabulary) and Respond appropriately by recognizing the intent behind 
these different expressions, which may involve handling variations in syntax, politeness, or 
regional usage.

Paraphrases: Two sentences that convey the same meaning, despite having different wording

Ambiguity: The response does not fully answer the intended request. 
"Can you turn on the light, please?" "Yes, I can!" The responder acknowledges that they can turn 
on the light but does not clarify whether they will actually do so.

Ambiguity and Vagueness: "Can you turn on the light, please?" The problem: There are multiple 
lights. This introduces vagueness because it’s unclear which light the user is referring to. 
The request lacks specific information, making it ambiguous for the listener or system to 
determine the correct action.

A single sentence can have different meanings, and the source of ambiguity can vary. Ambiguity 
in language occurs when a sentence or phrase can be interpreted in multiple ways. There are 
several types of ambiguity that can arise in natural language, making it a challenging task 
for NLP systems to resolve meaning accurately.

Lexical Ambiguity: Occurs when a word has more than one meaning.
Example: "She can't bear children." This could mean "She cannot tolerate children" or "She 
is unable to give birth to children."
